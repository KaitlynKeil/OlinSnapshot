### Requirements

To use Postgres as a database with Python, you will need psycopg2.
```
pip install psycopg2
pip freeze requirements.txt
```

### Development

If working with Postgres on Linux, 

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql
which psql
sudo -u postgres -i // Log into postgres to run
psql
\q // exits psql
exit // exits postgres
```

Once Postgres is installed and you can connect, youâ€™ll need to export the DATABASE_URL environment variable for your app to connect to it when running locally. `export DATABASE_URL=postgres://$(whoami)`.
